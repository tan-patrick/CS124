a. 

We would expect 100 individuals in the case group, since the probability of disease is P(d) = .10.
Then, N*p = 1000 * .10 = 100.

We run a binomial distribution with a .1 probability of each trial being a success. We run the test 1000 times (one per individual) with one trial each person (one chromosome per person).
We use the random binomial function and then sort the tests into 0s and 1s (allele vs no allele). 

In our trial, there were 108 individuals with the disease.

b.

We need to create 1000 individuals with 200 SNPs each. Each SNP has a .5 chance of being present (equal chance of being present or not present), except the first SNP. 
The first SNP should have a .95 chance of being present in 100 individuals, and a .25 chance of being present in the other 900 individuals.

To create a sample population of 1000 individuals, each with 200 SNPs, we first create an array of 1000 rows and 200 columns, and fill each index with either 0 or 1 randomly (.5 chance of each). 
Then, we create two new arrays of lengths 100 and 900, where the 100 length array has each index being 1 with a .95 chance, and the 900 length array with a .25 chance. 
Then, we replace the first column of every row with this array, which represents the causal SNP.
